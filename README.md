DermAssist is an Afrocentric digital dermatology assistant built to enhance the diagnosis, triage, and management of skin conditions—particularly those appearing on dark skin tones, which are historically underrepresented in medical datasets and diagnostic tools.

It combines AI-powered image analysis, localized knowledge, and clinical decision support to serve both healthcare providers and patients across Africa. DermAssist is not just a tool—it's a platform for equity in dermatological care, aiming to fill a critical gap in recognition, research, and access by:
- Offering accurate, inclusive diagnostic support for melanated skin
- Educating users (clinicians and patients) on common and neglected dermatoses
- Building the largest annotated dataset of Black and African skin conditions
- Facilitating early intervention and referral guidance in low-resource settings

At its core, DermAssist is a smart, culturally and clinically aware assistant that learns from African skin, speaks to African needs, and builds trust through data sovereignty, local validation, and accessibility.
